				  	<h2>Cooking</h2>
				  	<p>I've been passionate about cooking since I was in college. I was able to do two internships as well as a student job in this field, which reinforced the idea that cooking is what I love to do. I have also created an Instagram account and a YouTube channel dedicated to this passion.

				  	<h2>Rugby</h2>
				  	<p>I have been playing rugby for 10 years. I started rugby in the Suresnes club where I completed seasons, including one at a high level. Then when I reached high school I changed clubs to Versailles where I was able to join the development center. Today rugby is a sport that fascinates me and which I will always want to play.

				  	<h2>Trading</h2>
				  	<p>Trading is a subject that I recently discovered and that I have taken a liking to. It is a very interesting subject that requires reflection and work in order to achieve its goals. It's a complicated subject, but one that makes me want to improve.

				  	<h2>Volleyball</h2>
				  	<p>I played volleyball for 2 years and unfortunately had to stop for my studies. This team sport puts work at the fore because it is only by working that you can improve in this sport. It is also a sport that strengthens the team spirit and fighting spirit of each player.
